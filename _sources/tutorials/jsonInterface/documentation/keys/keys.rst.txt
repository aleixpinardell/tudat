List of keys
============

The type :literal:`path` denotes that a :literal:`string` such as :literal:`"@path(relPath)"` has to be provided when using relative paths inside modular files. When providing absolute paths or not using modular files, both :literal:`"@path(file)"` and :literal:`"file"` will work.

:literal:`T[]` denotes that an array of :literal:`T` is expected. If unidimensional array inference is supported, a single :literal:`T` is also valid. If no number is indicated, there is no constraint on the size of the array. For instance, :literal:`numeric[6]` is used for state vectors.



Simulation
~~~~~~~~~~

There are the keys that can be defined at root level:

numeric | initialEpoch | Used for the initial time of the integrator (if not provided inside the integrator object) and for interpolation of Spice ephemeris (if Spice enabled and set to preload ephemeris). | o | -

numeric | finalEpoch | Used for interpolation of Spice ephemeris (if Spice enabled and set to preload ephemeris) and to create the time-termination condition. | o | -

string | globalFrameOrigin | Used to set the global frame origin for the propagation. | o | "SSB"

string | globalFrameOrientation | Used to set the global frame orientation for the propagation. Updates the frame orientation of epehemeris and rotation model settings if not specified. | o | "ECLIPJ2000"

object | spice | Used to provide [Spice](Spice) settings. | o | -

object | bodies | Used to define all the [bodies](Body) to be considered in the propagation. The keys ob the object are the body names. | m | -

object[] | propagator | Used to define the [propagator(s)](Propagator). | m | -

object | integrator | Used to define the [integrator](Integrator). | m | -

object | termination | Used to define the [termination](Termination) conditions. | o | -

object[] | export | Used to define the [export](Export) settings. Each element represents an output file to which results will be saved. | o | -

object | options | Used to configure [options](Options) for the application. | o | -


Spice
~~~~~

bool | useStandardKernels | Whether the standard kernels should be preloaded. | m | -

path[] | alternativeKernels | Additional kernels to load when using standard kernels. | o | []

path[] | kernels | Kernels to load when not using standard kernels. | ? | -

bool | preloadKernels | Whether the kernels should be preloaded from `~/initialEpoch - interpolationOffsets.first` to `~/finalEpoch + interpolationOffsets.second` | o | true

numeric | interpolationStep | Step to use for interpolation of ephemeris. | o | 300

numeric[2] | interpolationOffsets | Offsets to use for the interpolation. | 0 | [10*interpolationStep, 10*interpolationStep]


Body
~~~~

bool | useDefaultSettings | Whether the default settings should be used. If any of the settings listed below is provided, the default settings will be overridden. | o | false

numeric[6] | initialState | Initial Cartesian state. Used to define a segment of the propagator's initial states (if not defined). | o | -

numericÂ | mass | Initial/constant mass. Used to define the constant mass of the body or its initial mass when it is varying, in which case it will be used to define an entry of the propagator's initial states (if not defined). | o | -

numeric[7] | rotationalState | Initial rotational state. Used to define a segment of the propagator's initial states (if not defined). | o | -

numeric | referenceArea | Area to be used for aerodynamics and radiation pressure settings (if not defined for these individual objects). | o | -

object | aerodynamics | Used to provide [aerodynamics](Aerodynamics) settings. | o | -

object | atmosphere | Used to provide [atmosphere](Atmosphere) settings. | o | -

object | ephemeris | Used to provide [ephemeris](Ephemeris) settings. | o | -

object | gravityField | Used to provide [gravity field](Gravity Field) settings. | o | -

object[] | gravityFieldVariation | Used to provide a list of [gravity field variation](Gravity Field Variation) settings. | o | -

object | radiationPressure | Used to provide a map of [radiation pressure](RadiationPressure) settings, in which the keys are the name of the radiating bodies. | o | -

object | rotationModel | Used to provide [rotation model](RotationModel) settings. | o | -

object | shapeModel | Used to provide [shape model](ShapeModel) settings. | o | -
