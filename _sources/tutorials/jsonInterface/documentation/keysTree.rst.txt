List of keys
============

The type :literal:`path` denotes that a :literal:`string` such as :literal:`"@path(relPath)"` has to be provided when using relative paths inside modular files. When providing absolute paths or not using modular files, both :literal:`"@path(file)"` and :literal:`"file"` will work.

:literal:`T[]` denotes that an array of :literal:`T` is expected. If unidimensional array inference is supported, a single :literal:`T` is also valid. If no number is indicated, there is no constraint on the size of the array. For instance, :literal:`numeric[6]` is used for state vectors.
