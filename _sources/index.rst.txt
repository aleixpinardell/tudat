==========

The TU Delft Astrodynamics Toolbox (Tudat) is a powerful set of C++ libraries that support astrodynamics and space research. These libraries are publicly available in Github (https://github.com/Tudat) for anyone to use and contribute to. The pages contained in this wiki provide an overview of all the guides, introductions, tutorials and feature documentation of the main building blocks of Tudat.

Tudat includes a wide variety of libraries, all the way from gravity models to numerical integrators and other mathematical tools. One of the key strengths within Tudat is its ability to combine such libraries in a powerful simulator framework. Such framework can be used for a wide variety of purposes, ranging from the study of reentry dynamics, interplanetary missions, etc. An example of a Tudat output is given in the animation below, which shows the orbits of the 30-satellite Galileo constellation.
