Tutorials
=========

These pages of the wiki describe a few tutorials on how to use the MATLAB Interface. The tutorials are divided in two categories depending on the usage mode: **seamless**, for examples set up and run directly from MATLAB, and **input-output**, for examples set up in MATLAB to generate input files that are then provided manually to the :literal:`json_interface` application.
